# Codex Protocol | Biddable Escrow

## Notes
- Everything under the zeppelin-solidity directory was copied over from node_modules/zeppelin-solidity to give visibility into the contract code and so they can be pinned to a specific compiler version. No extensive changes have been made
- This contract is not intended to be used directly on it's own. Users should instead communicate to the contract through instances of the Biddable Widget hosted by our consortium members
- If you accidentally send ERC-20 tokens to the address where this is deployed, please email contact@codexprotocol.com to discuss retrieval

## Thanks to
- OpenZeppelin for providing tons of contract functionality in their repo at https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity
